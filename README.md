### Regularized Regression in Boston Datasets

### Objective
Inn todayâ€™s world, data sets being analyzed typically have a large amount of features. As the number of features grow, our OLS assumptions typically break down and our models often overfit (aka have high variance) to the training sample, causing our out of sample error to increase. **Regularization** methods provide a means to control our regression coefficients, which can reduce the variance and decrease our of sample error.

### Dataset
The data is about predicting housing price (medv) in Boston city, features:
- Criminal rate (crim)
- Residential land zoned proportion (zn)
- Non-retail business acres proportion (indus)
- Is bounds with river (chas)
- Nitrogen oxides concentration (nox)
- Number rooms average (rm)
- Owner age proportion (age)
- Weighted distance to cities (dis)
- Accessibility index (rad)
- Tax rate (tax)
- Pupil-teacher ratio (ptratio)
- Black proportion (black)
- Percent lower status (lstat)

### Output
The output of the model is predicted boston housing prices.
